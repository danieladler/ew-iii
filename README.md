# EW III

This project pays homage to my grandfather (and gives me a front end playground) by turning a 1950's pamphlet into a 2017 responsive webpage.

Eugene Weston III, my maternal grandfather, was a third-generation architect who designed some really beautiful midcentury homes. When when I discovered a yellowing tri-fold pamphlet from the mid-50's describing his services, a lightbulb went off&#58; what if it was recreated word for word, film grain by film grain, but as a responsive web page? **ew-iii** is the result. Now I aspire for this to be an ongoing project where I continue to apply bits of front end knowledge as I learn new techniques.

**NB:** I'm pretty sure the photographs were taken by Julius Shulman, so all credit for these beautiful images goes to him and his estate.
