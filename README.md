# Express-Neat Boilerplate

Simple, barebones boilerplate for SPAs with minimal/vanilla JS. Made by [yours truly](https://www.dadler.codes).

To start dev server, run `npm start`

If you're not [me](https://www.github.com/danieladler), remember to replace the following in your version:
- copyright & social links in footer (unless you want to link your work to me!)
- fontawesome CDN embed code (it's easy to get your own [here](https://cdn.fontawesome.com/))

**Features**:
- light responsive behavior via Neat grid
- hero & fixed-bottom footer so that you don't have to recreate these from scratch
- modal that fills whole screen

**Tech Details**:
- grid system w/ [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
- live reloading w/ Gulp
- styling with SCSS

**TODO**:
- modular-ize SASS into separate files loosely following SMACSS
- maybe switch from Gulp to Webpack?
- add instructions for deploying via Heroku
- add more todos
